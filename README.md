# Temporal Drift of User Ratings on Recommender Systems

This repository contains notebooks that we have created during the research of temporal drift of user ratings on recommerder systems.

* Last stable version is the v8.

## Further Development

Latest version of the temporal drift research defines a basic framework for recommender systems. 

Upon completing temporal drift research we have made another research on recommendation systems. The next research;
* Examines the temporal drift in fine grained way.
* Static and Dynamic temporal drift is being researched and also provided enhanced version of the primitive framework that we have defined in temporal drift.
* The enhanced framework is called cimrec.
